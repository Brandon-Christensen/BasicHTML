        <p>
            I was born into a really sporty family, and as a result I played sports
            throughout 
            <br>
            my child. I played just about every sport, but I eventually
            found my 
            <br>
            favorite one to be tennis. I enjoy watching professional tennis, and my favorite player
            <br>
            is 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal">

        <p>
            Unlike sports, when I was a kid I hated hiking. I hated it
            <br>
            when my parents would drag me on a hike. As I get older and older,
            <br> 
            my appreciation for hiking has gone up. I really started enjoying hiking after
            <br> 
            I went on a night hike to 
            <a href="https://www.nps.gov/arch/planyourvisit/delicate-arch.htm">
                Delicate Arch.
            </a>
            Now I try to go hiking when I can.

        <p>
            Another thing I really like is snowboarding. I have currently been
            <br>
            snowboarding for about 4 years. Like hiking my interest in 
            <br>
            snowboarding started from something, well in this case someone.
            <br> 
            That someone is 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaun_White">
